# To Do List App

Allows user to add new tasks, with an option to mark the task as important. User can filter items by importance and completion status.

The 'Application State' heading provides an opportunity to see the current JSON contents of the state variable in use.

## Project Context

I started this quick project to practice the useReducer() and useContext() functions from React. I also ended up incorporating useRef() to focus on "Add new task" input following a form submission. Also made use of TailwindCSS & DaisyUI libraries.
